This is my first Python app - Music Player.
I guess there are some things that could be improved.
If you want to test it:
1. Open and create new python project.
2. Copy the code into a new python file.
3. Download the icon folder and place it in the project directory.
4. You need to install Tkinter: pip install tk.
5. And finally you need to install the rest of the used libraries by clicking on: Install packges.
If you don't want to do all these things, you can see what the application looks like in the picture below.
